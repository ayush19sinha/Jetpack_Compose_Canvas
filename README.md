### 2. Grayscale Effect
In this effect, the image is initially displayed in color except for a circular area that is grayed out. As you move the circle, it reveals the grayscale version of the image.

**Features:**
- **Color to Grayscale:** The image starts in color, with a circular area that displays a grayscale version. The grayscale area moves with your touch.
- **Drag Interaction:** The grayed-out circle follows your finger as you drag it across the screen.
