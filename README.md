# Jetpack Compose Canvas

Welcome to the Jetpack Compose Canvas repository! ðŸŽ¨

This repository showcases various visual effects and custom drawing techniques built using Jetpack Compose. The goal is to explore creative ways to manipulate images and graphics in modern Android applications.

## Effects

### 1. Flashlight Effect
This effect simulates a flashlight by revealing parts of an image through a circular area that follows your touch.

**Features:**
- **Interactive Dragging:** Move your finger across the screen to change the position of the flashlight.
- **Radial Gradient:** A soft radial gradient is applied around the touch area to enhance the flashlight effect.

### 2. Grayscale Effect
In this effect, the image is initially displayed in color except for a circular area that is grayed out. As you move the circle, it reveals the grayscale version of the image.

**Features:**
- **Color to Grayscale:** The image starts in color, with a circular area that displays a grayscale version. The grayscale area moves with your touch.
- **Drag Interaction:** The grayed-out circle follows your finger as you drag it across the screen.
